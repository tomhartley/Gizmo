# Spirodala

** Spirosand** is device that sketches patterns similar to those generated by a spirograph in sand.

### How does it work?

There are two stepper motors. One drives the horizontal motion of a magnet through a rack-and-pinion. The other drives the rotational movement of the plate the sand is sat upon.

### How can I build my own Spirosand?

Laser cut the files (in final_to_cut.dwg) into 3mm acrylic, then glue together, ensuring all joins are at 90 degrees while they're glued. Along with the laser cut parts, you will need the following items:

- 2 NEMA 17 Stepper Motors
- 1 Sanguinololu board, or arduino compatible board with 2 stepper drivers
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 micro switch to act as end-stop
- Some sand

On the linear axis, you should take the piece that moves (with the rack) and sand down the edges of each side so they're slightly chamfered. This helps this slider move more freely through the 4 supports.
